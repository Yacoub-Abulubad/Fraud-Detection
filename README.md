# Fraud-Detection
Detection of fraudulent survey patterns using autoencoders.

This was an internship assessment project that I was required to do, I have developed my skill using unsupervised learning with this project and had to expand my knowledge on autoencoders and houw they work.

UPDATE: In my defence this was one of the first "great" tasks I had and back then I was not that well structured and did not know OOP.
